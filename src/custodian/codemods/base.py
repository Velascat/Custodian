"""Codemod base — safe, diff-producing file transforms.

A Codemod is a targeted automated fix for a class of findings.  Each
codemod operates on a single file at a time and returns either the
transformed source or ``None`` (no change).

    class RemoveUnusedImport(Codemod):
        applies_to = {"ruff:F401", "I1"}

        def transform(self, path: Path, source: str) -> str | None:
            ...  # return new source, or None if nothing changed

Usage::

    from custodian.codemods.base import run_codemods
    changed = run_codemods(repo_path, findings, codemods, *, dry_run=False)

``run_codemods`` groups findings by file, runs applicable codemods, and
writes back only files that changed.  With ``dry_run=True`` it returns the
diff without writing.
